# OpenRouter integration

## Integration boundary

```mermaid

  UI[React renderer] -->|provider, model, settings| MAIN[MainController]
  MAIN --> KEY[Credential resolver]
  MAIN --> PROVIDER[OpenRouter provider]
  KEY -->|key only in memory| PROVIDER
  PROVIDER --> SDK[@openrouter/sdk]
  PROVIDER --> WEB[OpenRouter web-search endpoint]
  PROVIDER --> ACCESS[Computer access gate]
  PROVIDER --> GATEWAY[MCP tool gateway]
  GATEWAY --> MCP[stdio or Streamable HTTP MCP]
  ACCESS --> LOCAL[Local bounded tools]
  ACCESS --> REMOTE[Paired runner]
```

The OpenRouter key exists only in Electron's main process. The renderer sees a readiness label and source description, never the value.

## Credential resolution

`resolveOpenRouterCredential` checks sources in this order:

1. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the inherited process environment
2. The env file path saved in Grokky settings
3. The path in `GROKKY_OPENROUTER_ENV_FILE`
4. `$HOME/.config/grokky/.env`

An env file may use plain, quoted, or exported syntax:

```dotenv
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=replace_with_your_key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="replace_with_your_key"
```

The resolver requires an OpenRouter-style `sk-or-v1-` key with a non-placeholder value. Unreadable candidates are skipped. The selected file path may be stored so the app can resolve it on later launches, but the file contents and key are never copied into `conversations.json`.

## Client construction

The provider creates a typed SDK client per run:

```ts
const client = new OpenRouter({
  apiKey: context.apiKey,
  appTitle: "Grokky",
  appCategories: "desktop-agent,local-agent",
  timeoutMs: 180_000,
});
```

Each chat request also supplies the bearer header explicitly, uses the conversation ID as `sessionId`, and carries the current abort signal.

## Message construction

A lead run receives:

1. A Grokky system contract
2. Up to 40 preceding conversation messages
3. The current user prompt
4. Optional verified live-web findings
5. Optional specialist findings

The base system contract states the selected workspace, read/write state, command state, live-web state, evidence rules, secret rules, and product writing style.

Specialists do not receive chat history. Each gets one bounded task plus its agent description and developer instructions. This isolates their analysis and reduces agreement-by-copying.

## Dynamic tool catalog

The available tool list is rebuilt for each loop from:

- Global computer-access state
- Active local or remote device capabilities
- Capability policy
- Conversation sandbox mode
- Conversation command toggle
- Whether the loop is a read-only specialist

| Tool | Capability | Specialist | Additional condition |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| `list_files` | Files | Yes | Files not blocked |
| `search_files` | Files | Yes | Files not blocked |
| `read_file` | Files | Yes | Files not blocked |
| `create_file` | Files | No | Workspace-write mode |
| `edit_file` | Files | No | Workspace-write mode |
| `run_command` | Commands | No | Workspace-write and commands enabled |
| `browse_url` | Browser | Yes | Browser not blocked |
| `capture_screen` | Screen | Yes | Screen not blocked |
| `open_application` | Automation | No | Automation not blocked |
| `click_screen` | Automation | No | Automation not blocked |
| `type_text` | Automation | No | Automation not blocked |
| `mcp_<server>_<tool>_<hash>` | MCP | Read-classified only | Server enabled, schema accepted, tool not human-only |

Tools are advertised to the model only when the selected device supports them. A remote workspace runner currently advertises files and optionally commands, so it cannot accidentally receive screen or UI automation calls.

## MCP gateway

OpenRouter can use enabled Codex MCP server configurations through Grokky's main-process gateway. The renderer receives only server IDs, transport labels, safe connection state, tool names, descriptions, and policy classifications. Commands, arguments, environment values, HTTP headers, bearer tokens, OAuth tokens, and raw configuration never enter React or model messages.

The gateway supports local stdio and remote Streamable HTTP transports. Remote URLs require HTTPS except for loopback test or development servers. Local processes receive the SDK's limited inherited environment plus only their configured variables. MCP protocol messages and tool output are bounded.

Every discovered tool receives a stable namespaced function name. Schemas larger than 24 KB, deeper than eight levels, recursive through `$ref`, excessively broad, or colliding are rejected before model exposure. Results are capped at 40,000 characters.

Tool policy has four values:

| Classification | Lead model | Read-only specialist | Approval behavior |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Read | Yes | Yes | MCP capability policy applies |
| Write | Yes | No | MCP capability policy applies |
| External side effect | Yes | No | Defaults to Ask through MCP access |
| Human only | No | No | Model execution is denied |

Operator choices override server annotations. A server `readOnlyHint` becomes Read. Missing or ambiguous annotations default to External side effect. This fail-closed default prevents an unclassified mail, payment, deployment, or deletion tool from reaching a read-only specialist.

Remote OAuth uses the MCP SDK's PKCE, protected-resource discovery, authorization-server discovery, resource indicators, refresh flow, issuer binding, and dynamic client registration. Tokens are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` and stored under app user data. Failed refresh returns the server to an authorization-required state. Revocation calls the discovered endpoint when available, then removes local credentials.

## Tool loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant G as Grokky
  participant O as OpenRouter model
  participant A as Access gate
  participant T as Tool target

  G->>O: Messages, tools, model, reasoning
  O-->>G: Assistant message
  alt No tool calls
    G->>G: Return final text
  else Tool calls
    loop Calls in returned order
      G->>A: Tool name and parsed JSON args
      A->>A: Permission and boundary checks
      A->>T: Execute
      T-->>A: Result
      A-->>G: Result or denial
      G->>G: Emit normalized activity
      G->>O: Assistant tool call plus tool result
    end
  end
```

The implementation uses:

- Non-streaming typed chat responses
- `toolChoice: "auto"`
- `parallelToolCalls: false`
- A maximum of eight model rounds
- A 180-second SDK timeout
- Sequential tool execution in response order
- Model-visible `Tool error:` results when a bounded action fails

Sequential tool calls prevent two model-requested writes from racing against the same file. Crew members themselves can still run in parallel because they are read-only.

## Screen capture attachments

The local screen tool returns a private temporary pathname after a successful capture. Before the tool result goes back to OpenRouter, `openRouterToolContent` reads the PNG and converts it into an inline data URL plus explanatory text.

Safeguards:

- Capture requires macOS Screen Recording permission.
- The file is created with private permissions under Electron's temp area.
- Attachments larger than 10 MB are rejected.
- The image data is sent only to the active OpenRouter request.
- The pathname and image bytes are not persisted in conversation state.

## Live web research

Grokky uses OpenRouter's current server tool type, not the deprecated plugin-style web-search syntax:

```json
{
  "type": "openrouter:web_search",
  "parameters": {
    "engine": "auto",
    "max_results": 5,
    "max_total_results": 10,
    "max_uses": 3,
    "search_context_size": "medium"
  }
}
```

### Trigger

The research stage runs only when:

- Web search is enabled in settings, and
- The prompt contains an online or current-information intent such as search, browse, latest, current, news, sources, URL, or website.

### Audit requirements

The request sets `tool_choice` to required. Grokky accepts the result only when all three are present:

1. At least one reported server web-search request
2. At least one URL citation annotation
3. Non-empty research text

If the evidence is incomplete, the provider retries once. A second incomplete response fails the web-research stage instead of allowing the model to imply it searched.

The completed activity records:

- Search request count
- Research model
- Direct source URLs
- Whether a retry was required

The research brief and source links are added to the lead prompt. Usage and cost are added to the final conversation total.

## OpenRouter crew orchestration

OpenRouter does not expose Codex child threads, so Grokky provides its own equivalent orchestration layer.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  PROMPT[User prompt] --> SEARCH[Optional verified web research]
  SEARCH --> FAN[Create one loop per selected agent]
  FAN --> A[Specialist A, read-only]
  FAN --> B[Specialist B, read-only]
  FAN --> C[Specialist C, read-only]
  A --> ALL[Promise.all results]
  B --> ALL
  C --> ALL
  ALL --> LEAD[Lead loop with conversation permissions]
  LEAD --> FINAL[One final answer]
```

For each agent, Grokky:

1. Generates a synthetic OpenRouter thread ID for UI correlation.
2. Emits a real `spawn_agent` orchestration event.
3. Applies the agent's optional model and reasoning overrides.
4. Forces read-only workspace mode and disables commands.
5. Runs the tool loop independently.
6. Emits a `wait` event containing the completed finding or failure.

All agent promises begin before the provider awaits them. The lead runs only after the entire `Promise.all` settles. Failed specialists return an explicit failure finding so the lead and user can see degraded crew coverage.

The lead receives every specialist block with a role label, resolves disagreements, owns all final decisions, and is the only OpenRouter participant that can receive write or automation tools.

## Usage aggregation

Grokky normalizes:

- Input tokens
- Cached input tokens
- Output tokens
- Reasoning tokens
- Cost in US dollars when returned

Usage is accumulated across:

1. Optional web-research attempts
2. Every specialist loop and tool round
3. Every lead loop and tool round

The final `UsageSummary` is emitted once after the final answer.

## Current limitations

### Skills and connector plugins

OpenRouter MCP access is supported through the audited gateway. Codex skills and plugin connector runtimes are still native Codex capabilities and are not serialized into OpenRouter prompts or tool definitions unless they also expose an enabled MCP server.

### History window

The lead sends the most recent 40 prior chat messages, not the full persisted conversation. This is a simple bounded history policy rather than semantic memory.

### Web-search model

Live web research currently uses a dedicated constant. If model routing becomes user-configurable, preserve the evidence requirements and do not assume every model supports the same server tool.

## Adding a tool

1. Define a strict `ChatFunctionTool` schema.
2. Add a `ComputerToolName` and capability mapping.
3. Add target labeling for approvals and audit.
4. Implement the operation behind `ComputerAccessService` or the bounded workspace tool layer.
5. Validate paths, URLs, sizes, timeouts, output caps, and platform support.
6. Decide whether read-only specialists may receive the tool.
7. Decide whether remote devices advertise the capability.
8. Add deterministic permission, failure, and content tests.
9. For MCP, classify side effects and confirm specialist visibility.
10. Run `npm run verify` plus the relevant live smoke check.

## Troubleshooting

### OpenRouter shows as not configured

- Confirm the key uses the `sk-or-v1-` format.
- Confirm the launching shell exported `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or select the correct env file in settings.
- Confirm the env file uses an exact `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` assignment.
- Refresh provider status.

### The model talks about tools but does not use them

- Confirm Computer access is enabled.
- Confirm the active device advertises the needed capability.
- Confirm the capability is not blocked.
- Confirm writes or commands are allowed by the conversation.
- Inspect the work log for returned tool calls.

### Current answers have no sources

- Confirm live web search is enabled.
- Use a prompt that clearly requests current or online research.
- Inspect the `Live web search` activity for search count and direct URLs.
- Run `npm run smoke:openrouter-web`.

### Specialists appear serial

- Confirm more than one agent is selected.
- Confirm multi-agent is enabled and the thread limit is high enough.
- Run `npm run smoke:openrouter-crew`.
- Review the provider for an accidental replacement of `Promise.all` with sequential awaits.
